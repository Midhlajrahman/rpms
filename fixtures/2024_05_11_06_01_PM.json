However, when compared to other Gulf Cooperation Council nations, the UAE has the lowest corporate tax rate at 9%.

Only businesses engaged in activities like hydrocarbon exploration, production, or refining are subject to the Bahrain corporate tax. All other businesses involved in activities besides these are subject to a corporate tax at a rate of 0%. In addition, there are no taxes levied by the Kingdom on income, sales, capital gains, or estates.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA)</strong></p>\r\n<p>According to Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s tax code, which took effect on July 30, 2004, resident capital companies and non-residents conducting business operations through a permanent establishment (PE) are both subject to a 20% corporate income tax.
